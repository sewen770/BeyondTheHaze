# BEYOND THE HAZE DATATHON

## Description
This is a datathon from Yale-NUS 2019 studying what causes haze in Singapore. EDA was 
performed and found correlation between palm oil prices world wide and the 24hr PSI
in Singapore.  This correlation was made into a linear regression model.

Explaining the link, we also found that the price of palm oil is negatively correlated
to the amount of forest fire in Indonesia.  This was summarised in a barplot.

## Getting Started
Run EDA.R, preferably from R studios.
